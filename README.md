# TreeNativeRange_Shapefile
Here, I share my Shapefiles of the Native Ranges of some Tree species in the world. These are handmade shapefiles and are sometimes approximate according to the source precision. The source of the native range delineation is systematically included or quoted. 

This repository is for sharing and you are welcome to use these shapefiles and add to them if you wish.

- For European tree species, I recommend to download 
  - The "Chorological data for the main European woody" from Caudullo et al. (2020) species https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hr5h2hcgg4/15 , 
  - The EUFORGEN distributions maps of european tree species https://www.euforgen.org/
  - The points of occurrence of many species in Europe https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Occurrences_location_shapefile/3497891

- For North American tree species, I recommend 
  - The https://github.com/wpetry/USTreeAtlas repository of the "Atlas of United States Trees" by Elbert L. Little, Jr.

For the moment, this repository includes some Asian, Australian (Eucalyptus) and North African tree species and will be completed as I collect new species distribution maps.
